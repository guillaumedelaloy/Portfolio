Hello, my name is Guillaume Delaloy, I am a data scientist student!
In May 2017, I started an internship as a data scientist for 9 months in a data driven marketing company in Paris.
I will graduate from a dual degree in [Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENSAE_ParisTech) and [Business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESCP_Europe) in December 2018, and wish to pursue my career in the data science field!

# Projects


Some projects I built on my spare time.

#### Churn analysis




The objective of this [project](https://guillaumedelaloy.github.io/Churn_analysis/) is to understand and predict the churn of customers for a telecommunication company, in order to improve customers' retention. I will try to have a business oriented explanation of the project, so please go to the github repo for more details.








#### An example of a microservice application : airline complaints on Twitter


The objective of this [project](https://guillaumedelaloy.github.io/airlines-complaints-microservice/) is to determine which companies offer the best/worst customer experience, based on twitter complaints. This project is also an example of how we can leverage AWS tools to deploy an end to end serverless machine learning/ deep learning project.

# Master Thesis

In this paper, I presented an AWS based architecture that can be applied by B2B companies in order to automatically generate new leads. The process consists in targeting companies having an ideal profile for your offer, by automatically sending emails and analyse their answers thanks to sentiment analysis.


# MOOCs

The first MOOC I have completed is [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), from Andrew Ng (Stanford). I started studying the lessons from this MOOC because I wanted to get an internship as a data scientist. I really loved the teaching methods and examples, it makes you realize how powerful data science is ! After completing this course, I knew I wanted to become a data scientist.

I also followed a second MOOC, [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/) in order to get more familiar with deep learning. I had already used some DL packages like Keras but I wanted to sharpen my understanding of DL concepts. It was a great experience because it has been the opportunity to work with unstructured data like images, which I wasn't familiar with before. I really enjoyed this MOOC because it is a summary of state of the art algorithms and it remains very practical.
